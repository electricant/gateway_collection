# INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di RIcerca Metrologica) provides a synchronization
# service for informatics system connected to the Internet, based on two primary
# NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers installed at the Time Laboratory. They are
# synchronized, through a date code generator, by the commercial cesium beam
# hosted at that Laboratory.
